___

The Eye Exercise is the final project of the eighth week in the MIT xPRO Full Stack Development with MERN course.

## Project Description
The Eye Exercise allows you to move your cursor around the screen, and the eyes will follow it. This project primarily utilizes CSS.
___

## How to Run
To run this project after cloning the repository, you will find it consists of three main files:<br>
- `index.html`
- `styles.css`
- `eyes.js`

The `index.html` file sets up the DOM with two eye divs. The `eyes.js` file creates the eyes in the DOM and uses the `mousemove` event to make the eyes follow the cursor. The `styles.css` file defines the eye color and shape using the `.eye` and `.eyes` classes.
___

## Future Improvements
- Add a button to start/stop the eye movement.
- Include more facial features and expressions.
